## Introduction to GANs

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) were developed in 2014 by Ian Goodfellow and his teammates. They proposed a novel framework for estimating generative models via an adversarial process, in which one simulataneously trains two models: a generative model G that captures the data distribution, and a discrimative model D that estimates the probability that a sample came from the training data rather than G. The training procedure for G is to maximize the probability of D making a mistake. 

A generative adversarial network (GAN) has two parts:
  * The *generator* learns to generate plausible data. The generated instances become negative training examples for the discriminator.
  * The *discriminator* learns to distinguish the generator's fake data from real data. The discriminator penalizes the generator for producing implausible results.
